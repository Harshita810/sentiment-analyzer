Sentiment Analyzer â€“ Frontend + Backend

This project is a Sentiment Analyzer Web Application that classifies user-provided text into Positive, Negative, or Neutral categories. It is a beginner-friendly yet practical implementation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) combined with a clean frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and a simple backend (Flask in Python).

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate how modern machine learning or NLP concepts can be integrated with web technologies to create real-world applications. By analyzing the sentiment of text, businesses, students, and developers can understand customer feedback, product reviews, or general opinions more effectively.

âœ¨ Features

Frontend (HTML + CSS + JS):
A simple and responsive user interface where users can enter text for analysis. The design is kept clean and minimal so users can easily focus on the task.

Backend (Flask API in Python):
A lightweight Flask server that processes user input and returns sentiment predictions. Currently, it uses basic NLP logic but can easily be extended to integrate advanced models like NLTK, TextBlob, or HuggingFace Transformers.

Real-time Interaction:
The frontend and backend are connected via API calls, ensuring smooth and fast communication between the interface and the processing engine.

Extensible Architecture:
Developers can easily add more functionalities like sarcasm detection, emotion recognition, or multi-language support in the future.

ðŸš€ How It Works

User enters text in the input field on the web page.

The frontend sends the text to the backend using a POST request.

The Flask backend analyzes the sentiment of the text.

The predicted result (Positive, Negative, Neutral) is sent back to the frontend and displayed to the user.

ðŸ”® Future Scope

Integrating advanced deep learning models (BERT, RoBERTa).

Expanding dataset support for better accuracy.

Adding visualization dashboards for sentiment distribution.

Deploying the app on platforms like Heroku, Vercel, or AWS for public access.
